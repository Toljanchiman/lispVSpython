    Data:   Lists are core data sets for python so they use less
            memory, andalso they provide means for fast iteration

    Advice: List creation is expensive, as much as list appending
            If we create a list from start with the length required
            We can avoid mutating list length, because on low-level
            extending a list length will need to discard existing
            list and creating a new list with a new length.
            But mutating existing list element is not as expensive

    Method: Create a list of nones for optimized creation
            If we are on bottom level return this list
            Else create the child node recursively
            Now e overwrite left and right empty nodes with child
